# ROADMAP

## Overview

SMPL-X Toolbox aims to provide a comprehensive collection of developer utilities for working with the SMPL-X human parametric model. This roadmap outlines our planned features and development timeline for delivering essential tools that streamline workflows in 3D human body modeling and animation.

## Vision

To become the go-to toolkit for researchers, developers, and artists working with SMPL-X models, providing:
- **SMPL-X focused APIs** - all core functionality built specifically for SMPL-X models
- **Model conversion utilities** - convert SMPL/SMPLH to SMPL-X before processing
- **Seamless interoperability** with existing ecosystems (PyTorch, Trimesh, DCC tools)
- **Optimization frameworks** for fitting SMPL-X to various data sources
- **Format converters** for popular animation and 3D content creation pipelines

### Design Philosophy
**SMPL-X First:** Our core APIs are designed exclusively for SMPL-X models. Other model variants (SMPL, SMPLH) should be converted to SMPL-X format before use. This approach ensures:
- Consistent API surface with full expressiveness (body + hands + face)
- Simplified maintenance and testing
- Better performance and reliability
- Future-proof architecture for advanced features

## Architecture Principles

### SMPL-X Unified Approach

**Why SMPL-X Only?**
Our decision to focus exclusively on SMPL-X models in core APIs provides several key advantages:

1. **Unified Interface**: Single, consistent API surface reduces complexity
2. **Full Expressiveness**: Access to body, hands, and facial expressions in all operations
3. **Performance**: Optimized code paths without branching for different model types
4. **Future-Proof**: Built for the most advanced parametric model available
5. **Simplified Testing**: Comprehensive coverage without model variant combinatorics

**Model Conversion Strategy:**
- **Automatic Conversion**: Built-in utilities convert SMPL/SMPLH to SMPL-X seamlessly
- **Parameter Mapping**: Intelligent mapping preserves original pose and shape
- **Extension Handling**: Missing parameters (hands, face) initialized with neutral defaults
- **Backward Compatibility**: Convert SMPL-X back to simpler models when needed

**Supported Conversion Paths:**
```
SMPL â†’ SMPL-X (body pose + shape, neutral hands/face)
SMPLH â†’ SMPL-X (body + hands, neutral face)  
SMPL-X â†’ SMPL (body only, hands/face discarded)
SMPL-X â†’ SMPLH (body + hands, face discarded)
```
