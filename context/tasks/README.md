# Tasks

Current and planned work items for the SMPL-X Toolbox project.

## Structure

- **features/** - New feature implementation tasks and requirements
- **fixes/** - Bug reports, issue tracking, and fix documentation
- **refactor/** - Code refactoring plans and cleanup tasks
- **tests/** - Testing strategies, test cases, and quality assurance tasks

## Task Organization

Each task should include:
- Clear description of the work to be done
- Acceptance criteria and success metrics
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Estimated effort and complexity
- Status tracking and progress updates

## Naming Convention

Tasks follow the pattern: `task-[action]-[component]-[description].md`

Examples:
- `task-implement-optimization-algorithms.md`
- `task-fix-mesh-rendering-issues.md`
- `task-refactor-parameter-validation.md`
- `task-add-integration-tests.md`

## Status Tracking

Use status indicators in filenames or headers:
- **Active** - Currently being worked on
- **Planned** - Scheduled for future work
- **Blocked** - Waiting on dependencies
- **Completed** - Finished and verified
- **Cancelled** - No longer needed
