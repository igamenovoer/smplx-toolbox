## Usage Guidelines

### For Decision Making
- Consult relevant summaries before making major decisions
- Use summaries to understand the rationale behind existing choices
- Reference summaries when explaining decisions to stakeholders
- Update summaries when new information changes conclusions

### For AI Assistants
- Reference summaries to understand project context and history
- Use summaries to provide informed recommendations
- Suggest updates to summaries when discovering new information
- Create new summaries to consolidate scattered knowledge

## Integration

Summaries connect with other context directories:
- **Plans** - Provide analytical foundation for strategic planning
- **Design** - Inform architectural and technical design decisions
- **Logs** - Consolidate insights from implementation experience
- **Tasks** - Provide context for feature prioritization and planning

## Maintenance

### Regular Review
- **Update summaries** when new information becomes available
- **Validate conclusions** against actual implementation experience
- **Archive obsolete summaries** with clear deprecation notes
- **Create new summaries** for emerging areas of knowledge

### Version Control
- **Track changes** to understanding and conclusions over time
- **Maintain history** of major revisions and the reasons for them
- **Cross-reference** related summaries and note dependencies
- **Preserve legacy versions** when they contain valuable historical context

### Quality Assurance
- **Peer review** summaries for accuracy and completeness
- **Validate data sources** and ensure citations are current
- **Test recommendations** through implementation or pilot projects
- **Gather feedback** from users of the summaries

Summary documents are living resources that evolve with project understanding, providing a foundation of knowledge that supports informed decision-making and effective project execution.
