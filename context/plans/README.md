## Purpose

Implementation plans serve to:
- **Coordinate complex work** across multiple components and sessions
- **Set clear milestones** with measurable success criteria
- **Identify dependencies** between different work streams
- **Allocate resources** effectively across competing priorities
- **Communicate vision** to team members and AI assistants
- **Track progress** against long-term objectives

## Document Format

Each plan should include a comprehensive structure:

```markdown

```

## Planning Principles

### Strategic Alignment
- Plans should support the overall project goals and vision
- Consider impact on users, developers, and the broader ecosystem
- Balance short-term needs with long-term sustainability

### Realistic Scope
- Break down complex features into manageable phases
- Account for learning curves and unexpected challenges
- Include buffer time for research, debugging, and iteration

### Clear Dependencies
- Identify prerequisite work and external dependencies
- Plan for dependency failures or delays
- Design fallback strategies where possible

### Measurable Outcomes
- Define specific, testable success criteria
- Include both technical and user-facing metrics
- Plan for progress tracking and course correction

## Plan Types

### Implementation Plans
Focus on **how** to build specific features or systems:
- Technical approach and architecture decisions
- Development phases and component interactions
- Integration strategies and testing approaches
- Performance requirements and optimization plans

### Roadmaps
Focus on **when** and **what** will be delivered:
- Feature prioritization and release planning
- Timeline coordination and milestone tracking
- Resource allocation and capacity planning
- Stakeholder communication and expectation management

### Strategic Plans
Focus on **why** and **what** direction to take:
- Technology choices and architectural decisions
- Market positioning and competitive differentiation
- Community building and ecosystem development
- Long-term sustainability and maintenance strategies

## Usage Guidelines

### For Project Planning
- Create plans before starting complex, multi-session work
- Use plans to coordinate between different development areas
- Update plans based on implementation experience and changing requirements
- Reference plans when making architectural and priority decisions

### For AI Assistants
- Consult relevant plans when working on features or components
- Update plan status based on implementation progress
- Suggest plan modifications when discovering better approaches
- Use plans to understand project context and dependencies

## Integration

Plans connect with other context directories:
- **Tasks** - Specific work items that implement plan phases
- **Design** - Technical specifications that support plan objectives
- **Logs** - Implementation history that validates or challenges plan assumptions
- **Summaries** - Knowledge consolidation that informs plan updates

## Maintenance

- Review and update plans regularly based on implementation experience
- Archive completed plans with lessons learned summaries
- Create new plans when project scope or direction changes significantly
- Use plan reviews to improve planning processes and accuracy

## Success Indicators

Effective plans should:
- Provide clear guidance for implementation decisions
- Help coordinate work across multiple development sessions
- Reduce uncertainty and scope creep during development
- Enable accurate progress tracking and timeline estimation
- Support successful delivery of complex features and systems
