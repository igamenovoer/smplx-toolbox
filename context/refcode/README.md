# SMPL-X Toolbox

## Overview

The SMPL-X Toolbox is a Python library designed to provide a comprehensive set of utilities for working with SMPL-X and SMPL-H human parametric models. The project focuses on developing a set of utility functions for:

- Loading and converting SMPL-X and SMPL-H models.
- Fitting models to 2D images and 3D keypoints.
- Posing models according to specific user requirements.
- Converting models to and from different DCC-oriented formats (like UE5, Maya, and Blender).
- Converting from other formats, such as text2motion skeletons.

## Development Approach

The library is developed in an iterative manner, with each round of development touching on all aspects of the functional requirements. This ensures that the library is continuously improving and that new features are added in a structured and organized way.

## Reference Code

This directory contains working code examples, reference implementations, and third-party integrations that serve as patterns for new development. These examples demonstrate best practices and proven approaches for working with the SMPL-X and SMPL-H models.
