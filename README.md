# SMPL-X Toolbox

A comprehensive collection of developer utilities for working with the SMPL-X human parametric model. This toolbox aims to provide essential tools for researchers, developers, and artists working with 3D human body modeling and animation.

## Overview

SMPL-X (SMPL eXpressive) is an expressive body model that extends SMPL with articulated hands and an expressive face. This toolbox provides utilities to streamline common workflows when working with SMPL-X models, making it easier to integrate human body modeling into various applications and pipelines.

## Planned Features

### 🎯 Optimization Tools
- Parameter optimization algorithms for fitting SMPL-X to various data sources
- Pose and shape optimization utilities
- Custom loss function implementations
- Constraint-based optimization helpers

### 📊 Objective Generation
- Automatic objective function generation for common fitting scenarios
- Landmark-based objectives
- Silhouette matching objectives
- Motion capture alignment objectives
- Multi-view consistency objectives

### 🎨 Visualization
- Interactive 3D visualization tools
- Mesh rendering utilities
- Animation playback and scrubbing
- Parameter space visualization
- Comparison tools for before/after optimization

### 🔄 Format Conversion
- Export utilities for popular DCC (Digital Content Creation) tools:
  - Blender integration
  - Maya/3ds Max compatibility
  - Unreal Engine/Unity support
  - Houdini workflows
- Standard format converters (FBX, OBJ, glTF, USD)
- Animation data conversion tools

### 🛠️ Utilities
- SMPL-X model loading and manipulation
- Batch processing tools
- Configuration management
- Data pipeline helpers
- Validation and debugging utilities

## Target Applications

- **Research**: Academic research in computer vision, graphics, and human motion analysis
- **Animation**: Character animation and rigging for films, games, and VR/AR
- **Fitness & Health**: Body measurement and posture analysis applications
- **Fashion**: Virtual try-on and garment fitting simulations
- **Motion Capture**: Processing and retargeting motion capture data

## SMPL-X Background

SMPL-X is a unified model that represents:
- **Body**: Based on the SMPL model with 10 shape parameters and 23 joint rotations
- **Hands**: Detailed finger articulation with MANO hand model integration
- **Face**: Expressive facial modeling with flame-based face model
- **Eyes**: Separate eye pose parameters for realistic gaze modeling

The model uses a learned linear blend skinning approach with pose-dependent corrective blend shapes, making it differentiable and suitable for optimization-based fitting.

## Getting Started

> **Note**: This project is currently in the planning phase. Implementation details and APIs are being designed and will be added progressively.

### Prerequisites
